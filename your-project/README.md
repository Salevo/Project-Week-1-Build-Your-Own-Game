## Project Description
This is a classic hangman game with a German twist. All words that you have to guess are in German and extremely hard.

## Rules
You have to guess the letter or the complete word in order to win.
As long as your guess is right you can keep on guessing. However you only have 5 wrong guesses before you loose the game. Don't worry, you can play again!

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

## Organization
I organised my project with trello into tasks which are either in progress, almost done , done or in review. I also assigned deadlines to some tasks in order to be reminded.

I tried to keep it as clean and lean as possible, so it contains a gitignore, a readme, my code in a jupyter notebook, as well as my code in .py file so people can run it on their terminal.
